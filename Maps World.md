# Garoua City: Black n’ White Edition 
Garoua is one of the most densely populated and urbanized town in Cameroon. It is crossed by the Benoue River. However, it is important to note the contrast in the urban area and road network of the Garoua’s city between the 2 banks of the river. This is mainly because the left bank is very often flooded in the rainy season, while the right bank has become more densely populated over time. This black and white Map illustrates this analysis.

# Douala City Map
Using OpenStreetMap data, we have created a map of the Douala urban community, including neighbouring departments and localities, as well as well-known districts within the city. The city's diversity of land use, from waterways and mangroves to urban areas, is a constant source of delight.

# Maroua City: Land of Sun Edition
I’m excited to share with you my map of the city of Maroua based on a white and yellow theme. Using data from OpenStreetMap, and hillshading from ArcGIS Pro, this map reveals the city’s urban layout, but also some of the reasons that are holding back urban expansion in these directions.
